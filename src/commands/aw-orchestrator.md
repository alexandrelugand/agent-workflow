# aw-orchestrator — One story, full cycle, checkpoints kept

Target story: $ARGUMENTS

You conduct the cycle; you never do a phase's work inline when a subagent owns it, and you never write code yourself. The two human checkpoints are non-negotiable: plan validation and ship confirmation. A checkpoint is an actual AskUserQuestion call — never a rhetorical sentence in your output. This is a conductor, not an autopilot.

## Phase 0 — Prerequisites (fail-closed)
The orchestrator drives one story's cycle — it never replaces the framing. Check, in order:
1. docs/prd.md exists? Missing → STOP: "No PRD — the pipeline starts with /aw-prd <target>. Nothing to orchestrate yet."
2. docs/stories.md exists? Missing → STOP: "No stories — run /aw-stories first."
3. docs/architecture.md exists? Missing → STOP: "No architecture — run /aw-architect first."
4. docs/reviews/stories.md says `Stories ready: yes`? If missing or negative, warn (don't stop): the breakdown hasn't passed /aw-stories-review.
(docs/design-system.md is not required here: Phase 2 fail-closes on it only when the story has UI.)

Then resolve $ARGUMENTS to the story id (`s<number>-<slug>`) against docs/stories.md. No unambiguous match → list the available stories and stop. Never invent a framing doc or a story to keep going.

Invoke the `worktree-manager` subagent with the resolved id and repository base
directory. Continue only after it returns the absolute `.worktrees/<id>` path,
confirms branch `feature/<id>` and a clean status. Every phase below, every
subagent and both checkpoints operate on files in that worktree. Never create
or checkout the feature branch in the repository base directory.

## Phase 0.5 — Integration Setup (Optional)

Check if integrations are enabled:

### JIRA Integration
If JIRA is enabled in `src/config/integrations.yaml`:
1. Read `docs/prd.md` for story details
2. Create JIRA Epic if needed: `/aw-integrate-jira`
3. Create JIRA Requirement if needed: `/aw-integrate-jira`
4. Create JIRA Task if needed: `/aw-integrate-jira`
5. Update `docs/integrations/<id>.md` with JIRA ticket IDs

### GitHub Integration
If GitHub is enabled in `src/config/integrations.yaml`:
1. Read `docs/stories.md` for story details
2. Create GitHub Issue: `/aw-integrate-github`
3. Update `docs/integrations/<id>.md` with GitHub issue number

### Telegram Integration
If Telegram is enabled in `src/config/integrations.yaml`:
1. Send initialization notification: "🚀 Pipeline started: Story <id> — <story-name>"
2. Set up event notifications for each phase

**Note**: Integration setup happens automatically via integration service. Manual steps above are for initial setup only.

## Phase 1 — Research
If docs/research/<id>.md doesn't exist, produce it now following the aw-research contract: codebase-analysis skill on the story's scope, current state of the code, output structured by @templates/research.md. Otherwise reuse the existing file.

## Phase 2 — Design (UI stories only)
If the story has a screen and docs/designs/<id>/design.md doesn't exist, follow the aw-design contract: fail-closed on docs/design-system.md (missing → stop and point to /aw-design-system), resolve the path without blocking autonomy (autonomous agent, or a brief for an external tool — ask only when a human is in the loop), produce a finished screen anchored to the design system only, then render it and look at it. Output docs/designs/<id>/design.md + mockup.html. A story without UI skips this phase.

## Phase 3 — Plan
If docs/plans/<id>.md doesn't exist, produce it following the aw-plan contract: small verifiable tasks, structured by @templates/plan.md.

CHECKPOINT — mandatory, whether the plan is new or already existed. If the plan's frontmatter already says `validated: yes`, continue. Otherwise present the plan summary (tasks, files touched, test strategy) and ask via AskUserQuestion: "Validate this plan?" — options: Validate / Modify / Stop. An existing plan file does NOT count as validated. On Validate, set `validated: yes` in the plan's frontmatter. Anything else: don't touch the marker, don't continue.

## Phase 4 — Execute
Fail-closed: docs/plans/<id>.md must carry `validated: yes` in its frontmatter — missing means back to the Phase 3 checkpoint. Then delegate to the `implementer` subagent exactly as /aw-execute does, with the verified absolute worktree as its working directory: no red-first ceremony and no invariant mutations, focused suite per task and the full suite plus the end-to-end once at the end, the type check after the last edit, no branch switching, only what the plan specifies; fix mode first if a blocking review exists. Capture its summary.

**Telegram Notifications** (if enabled):
- Send progress updates during task execution
- Notify on task completion
- Alert on compilation errors

## Phase 5 — Review
Delegate to the `reviewer` subagent exactly as /aw-review does: fresh context, story diff `git diff <default-branch>...feature/<id>`, test suite run by the reviewer, verdict ending with the exact `Max severity:` and `Ship allowed:` lines. Write the report to docs/reviews/<id>.md.

**Telegram Notifications** (if enabled):
- Send review results
- Alert on review passed or failed
- Notify on critical issues

**JIRA Update** (if enabled):
- Update JIRA task status (In Progress → Done/Blocked)
- Add review comments if applicable

Gate: verdict `Ship allowed: no` → go back to Phase 4 in fix mode. Maximum 2 fix loops; still blocked after that → stop and report the open findings. Never soften a verdict to move on.

## Phase 6 — Ship
CHECKPOINT — review passed: show the verdict and ask via AskUserQuestion: "Ship now?" — options: Ship / Not now. Only an explicit Ship proceeds; then run /aw-ship's flow: mechanical gate (`grep -q '^Ship allowed: yes' docs/reviews/<id>.md`), tests on the branch, push, PR — then the project's ship strategy (manual, the default: stop at the PR; auto: merge, deploy, confirm live, clean up the branch once the merge is proven).

**Telegram Notifications** (if enabled):
- Send PR created notification
- Send story completion notification
- Send success message

**GitHub Integration** (if enabled):
- Create PR with structured description (via `/aw-ship`)
- Comment on GitHub issue with PR link
- Add labels to PR if configured

**JIRA Update** (if enabled):
- Update JIRA task status to Done
- Add PR link to ticket description

End with: "Story <id> shipped. Cycle complete." (auto mode), "PR opened — merging is yours." (manual mode) — or the exact blocking state if stopped (which phase, what's missing).
