# aw-execute — Delegated implementation

Target story: $ARGUMENTS

## Execution contract (non-negotiable)
You MUST complete this command by delegating to the `implementer` subagent. You are FORBIDDEN from:
- Writing or modifying code yourself — you don't have the Write/Edit/Bash tools, on purpose.
- Starting the implementation without a validated plan in docs/plans/<id>.md.
- Running a story from the repository base directory, whatever its complexity.
- Creating or checking out the story branch in the repository base directory.
- Summarizing work the agent didn't actually do.

If you can't invoke the Agent tool, stop and report the error. Don't improvise.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Prerequisites (fail-closed)
1. Resolve $ARGUMENTS to the story id (`s<number>-<slug>`) against docs/stories.md. No unambiguous match → list the available stories, STOP.
2. Resolve `<repository-base>/.worktrees/<id>` and verify its branch is exactly `feature/<id>`. Missing worktree, wrong branch, detached HEAD or the repository base directory itself → STOP and run `/aw-research <id>` to bootstrap the feature workspace. Never improvise another branch or path.
3. From that worktree, read docs/plans/<id>.md. If it doesn't exist, STOP: ask for /aw-plan <id> first. Go no further.
4. Check the plan's frontmatter: it must contain `validated: yes`. Otherwise STOP: "Plan not validated. Review it, then rerun /aw-plan <id> to validate."
5. Read docs/reviews/<id>.md from the worktree if it exists. If it contains `Ship allowed: no`, this is a FIX run: the review findings come first.

### Step 2 — Delegate
Invoke the Agent tool:
- subagent_type: implementer
- description: Implement story <id>
- working directory: the absolute dedicated worktree path verified in Step 1.
- prompt: Implement story <id> from docs/plans/<id>.md, following docs/architecture.md and AGENTS.md. Read docs/research/<id>.md first when it exists — the plan decides, the research holds the verified facts and the traps, and you commit it. The worktree and branch are already prepared and verified: do not create a worktree, switch branches, checkout, or stash. Task by task, in plan order: write the task as a whole block, run its focused suite, tick the checkbox. No red-first ceremony and no invariant mutations. Focused suite per task; full suite once at the end (twice if a task touched a shared file); end-to-end once at the end, never in the loop; the type check once at the very end, after the last edit. Where the tests go, and the budget of about 25 per story, are settled in AGENTS.md, "Where the tests go". One single commit at the end of the story, carrying the story docs and every task — never one commit per task. Implement only what the plan specifies.
- On a FIX run, prepend to the prompt: This story was blocked in review. Fix every critical and major finding from docs/reviews/<id>.md first, then finish any unimplemented plan task.

Wait for the agent to finish. Capture its summary.

### Step 3 — Report
Summarize: tasks done, files touched, tests added, and any blocker the agent reported. No line-by-line detail.

End with: "Implementation done. Next step: /aw-review <id>"
